## Overview 

The server component of the e-commerce web application is designed to handle API requests for product displays, shopping cart management, and AI-enhanced functionalities using [OpenAi API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). It's built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for a simplified yet powerful RESTful API. On the other hand, front-end part of this project uses [React.js](https://react.dev/).

### Build Command

- `cd client && npm install && npm run build`: Navigates to the `client` directory, installs dependencies, and builds the front-end application. We should change it because our directory and commands are not default in client part.

### Output Directory

- `client/build`: Designates the directory where the static assets generated by the build are located.

### Rewrites
>
> - Used to define routing rules for incoming requests.
>
> ##### API Routes
>
> - `source: "/api/(.*)"`: All requests to paths starting with `/api/` are directed to the `index.js` file within the `/api` directory.
> - `destination: "/api/index.js"`: The single entry point for handling API requests.
>
> ##### SPA Routes
>
> - `source: "/(.*)"`: All other requests are rewritten to the root path.
> - `destination: "/"`: Serves the `index.html` of the SPA, allowing client-side routing to handle the request.
